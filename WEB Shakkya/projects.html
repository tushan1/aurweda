          <h3>The Pettah Floating Market</h3>
          <span>Colombo</span>
          <p>The Pettah Floating Markets are located on Bastian Mawatha in Pettah, a neighborhood in Colombo, Sri Lanka, and consist of 92 trade stalls, with a number of the stalls established on boats on Beira Lake.The floating market serves as a tourist attraction selling local produce and local handicraft
          The development of the floating market and beautification works were carried out by the GDP Constructions at a cost of Rs. 150 million. Engineering units from the Sri Lanka Army in collaboration with the GDP Constructions transformed Bastian Street, the street linking the Central Bus Stand in Pettah and the Colombo Fort railway station, into a green environment. The Sri Lanka Navy rehabilitated the polluted canal running alongside Bastian Street. The unique simple architecture of the stalls along the canal, designed by Thushari Kariyawasam, with grey cemented floors and minimalistic décor, tries to reflect the calm and undisturbed water of lake.
         The markets were officially opened by the Minister of Health, Maithripala Sirisena, on 25 August 2014 </p>
